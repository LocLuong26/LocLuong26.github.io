### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3, because with the knowledge we had then, we were able to complete a complex code to compute a game of Blackjack. We used command line arguments and artthmetic computing to recognize face cards and number cards. This was the first time I had strugglerd with using arithmetic operators, but the experience was fun over all.
* Lab 2
    Lab 2, part 2, taught me early on they syntax is a fundamental step in creating efiicint and credible code. This lab part helped me build habit in always remembering to double check my syntax and to rewrite incorrect code. I think that this lab helpe me build confidence and will continue to remind me theimportance of syntax down my carrer.
* Lab 9
    Lab 9, part 1, was about calvuating the Olympic values and their average. Weâ€™ve done alot of average computing this year, however this particular lab was my favorite because we could get rid of numbers that were too low, or too high, to get the exact number. This lab showed me that having a good understanding of math, plays a large role in understanding computer since, and how the two are related.
