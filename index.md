# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Loc Luong and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    In lab 5, part 3, I was able to write code for a Blackjack game that performs input validation through command line arguments, nested loops, and the use of vectors. I used command line arguments and arithmetic computing to recognize face cards, "A, J, K," from number cards. This was the first time I had struggled with using arithmetic operators, however, I was able to learn from this experience.
* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2, taught me early on that correct syntax is a fundamental step in creating efficient and credible code. This lab part helped me build a habit of always remembering to double-check my syntax and rewrite incorrect code. I think that this lab helped me build confidence in my coding abilities, and taught me how useful GitHub is as a learning platform for computer scientists.
* Lab 9

    In lab 9, part 1, I was able to calculate the Olympic values and their average through function definitions and vectors. Weâ€™ve done alot of average computing this year, however, this particular lab was my favorite because we could get rid of numbers that were too low, or too high, to get the exact value I wanted. This lab showed me that having a good understanding of math plays a large role in understanding computers, and how the two are related.
