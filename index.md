### CPSC 120

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-dyllan-loc)

    In Lab 5, Part 3, I wrote code for a Blackjack game that uses command line arguments, nested loops, and vectors to ensure the input is valid. I utilized arithmetic operators to distinguish face cards (A, J, K) from number cards. This was a new challenge for me, as I had never used arithmetic operators in this way before. However, I was determined to learn and overcome this obstacle. After some trial and error, I was able to successfully implement the necessary code to recognize face cards in my Blackjack game. This experience taught me the value of perseverance and the importance of continuing to learn and grow as a programmer.
* [Lab 2](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-LocLuong26)

    In Lab 2, Part 2, I was introduced to the importance of correct syntax in creating effective and reliable code. This lesson was an important one, as it helped me develop a habit of always checking my syntax before running my code. By carefully reviewing my code and making sure the syntax was correct, I was able to avoid many common errors and write more efficient programs. This lab also taught me the value of using a platform like GitHub for learning and practicing computer science. By sharing my code and collaborating with others on the platform, I was able to learn from my peers and improve my skills. I also gained valuable experience working with version control, which is an essential tool for any computer scientist.* 
* [Lab 9](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-09-spencer-elisa)

    In Lab 9, Part 1, I had the opportunity to practice calculating the Olympic values and their average using function definitions and vectors. While we have done a lot of average computing throughout the year, this particular lab stood out to me because it allowed me to exclude outliers and get more precise results. This was a valuable learning experience, as it showed me the power of using functions and vectors to manipulate data and make calculations more precise. Furthermore, this lab reinforced the importance of having a strong foundation in math for understanding computers and how the two disciplines are connected. By using mathematical concepts and techniques in my code, I was able to write more efficient and effective programs. This experience emphasized the critical role that math plays in computer science and the value of continuing to develop my mathematical skills.
