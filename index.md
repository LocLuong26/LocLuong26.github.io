### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3, because with the knowledge we had then, we were able to complete a complex code to compute a game of BLackjack. We used command line arguments and arithmetic computing to recognize face cards from number cards. This was the first time I had struggled with using arithmetic operators, however, I was able to learn and succeed in the end. 
* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2, taught me early on they syntax is a fundamental step in creating efficient and credible code. This lab part helped me build a habit of always remembering to double-check my syntax and rewrite incorrect code. I think that this lab helped me build confidence and will continue to remind me of the importance of syntax in my career.
* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1, was about calculating the Olympic values and their average. Weâ€™ve done alot of average computing this year, however, this particular lab was my favorite because we could get rid of numbers that were too low, or too high, to get the exact number. This lab showed me that having a good understanding of math plays a large role in understanding computers, and how the two are related.
